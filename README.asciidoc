This script installs the whole pipeline, into the current repository.

== Requirements

The machine you're installing onto only requires the following:

* `git`
* `python`
* `wget`
* `pkg-config`
* `gfortran`
* `g++`

== Development and testing

Included in this repository is a `Vagrantfile` which sets up a debian virtual machine, and provisions the minimal initial requirements listed above.
