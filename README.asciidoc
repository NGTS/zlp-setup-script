= Pipeline setup script
Simon Walker <s.r.walker101@googlemail.com>

This script installs the whole pipeline, into the current repository.

To install the pipeline into the current directory, run the `setup.py` script. This downloads everything and compiles all required programs.

Afterwards you need to add to your .bashrc:

[source,sh]
----
#Â <dir> is the location you installed to
export PATH=${HOME}/anaconda/bin:${PATH}:<dir>/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<dir>/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
----

== Requirements

The machine you're installing onto only requires the following:

* `git`
* `python`
* `wget`
* `pkg-config`
* `gfortran`
* `g++`

== Development and testing

Included in this repository is a `Vagrantfile` which sets up a debian virtual machine, and provisions the minimal initial requirements listed above.
